### The repository contains the following 

a. CP3 Code - with make files 
b. Solution to problems given in CP3 - chapter wise. 
c. Solutions picked from online sources along with problem list which is to be solved. 
d. Puzzles from http://www.mindcipher.com which I started solving  - has solutions available on the same page for readability. 

Plan is to finally keep CP3 solved problems with problem statment and puzzles separate.
