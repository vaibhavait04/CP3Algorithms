Mary add Sue are playing with dices. Rules are simple: at the begging each of them puts coin
on the table and roll a dice. Wins a player who rolled a larger number. If numbers are the same,
coins stay on the table for a next round. In order to make this game more interesting they 
decided to play now with normal dices, but with dice that can have arbitrary number of bones, from 0 
till 9. However each round must be played with same dice by both players.</P><P>Girls have been playing this game for a day long, till Mary run out of coins (nevertheless she had
more coins at the beginning of the game). Now Mary is confused. How could she have lost all her coins?
She thinks that Sue had been cheating. Before each roll Mary wrote on a paper numbers of bones on each 
side of the dice. Now she wonders if same dice was always used during one round. Help her to find it 
out.
