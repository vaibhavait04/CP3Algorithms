<P>
These days Soha is so busy that he doesn't have time to do his own homework. 
But this is not a big problem since he has got many friends who are willing to help. 
One if his friend's name is Sparrow.
Whenever Soha is assigned any homework, he turns to Sparrow for her help.

Sparrow has given a list of subjects that she is comfortable with along with the number of days it will take her to complete an assignment 
for each subject. Soha has got only <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> days to complete his next assignment. However, the professor of this subject is a little flexible 
and allows late submissions up to 5 days. That means he will not accept any submission that is after <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I> + 5</SPAN> days from now. 
Will Sparrow be able to do it for Soha this time?

<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
First line of input is a positive integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> (<!-- MATH
 $T \ le 100$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I>&nbsp;<I>le</I>100</SPAN>) that determines the number of test cases. 
Each case starts with a line containing an 
integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> that represents the number of subjects Sparrow is comfortable with. Each of the next <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> lines contain the name of a subject 
followed by the number of days it will take Sparrow to complete an assignment of that subject. All these subject names will be distinct. 
The next line contains an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN>. The meaning of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> is described above. The following line contains the name of the subject 
whose homework is due. All the subjects' names consist of lowercase letters and the length of each is at least 1 
and at most 20. All the integer inputs are positive in the range [1,100].

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
For each case, first output the case number first starting from 1. If Sparrow doesn't take more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> days to completely
the assignment, output `<TT>Yesss</TT>'; if she takes more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I></SPAN> days but not more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I> + 5</SPAN>, output `<TT>Late</TT>'; if she takes 
more than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>D</I> + 5</SPAN> days or if she isn't comfortable with the subject, output `<TT>Do your own homework!</TT>'.
Quotes are for clarify only and don't need to be part of the output. Look at the samples for more details. Be careful about the spelling.
