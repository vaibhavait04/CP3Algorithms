<P>
Michael graduated of ITESO this year and finally has a job. He's making a lot of money, but somehow never seems to have 
enough. Michael has decided that he needs to grab hold of his financial portfolio and solve his financing problems. 
The first step is to figure out what's been going on with his money. 

<P>
Michael has his bank account statements and wants 
to see how much money he has. Help Michael by writing a program to take his closing balance from each of the past twelve 
months and calculate his average account balance. 

<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 

<P>
The first line of input contains a single integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, (<!-- MATH
 $1 \le N \le 100$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 SRC="11945img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$">100</SPAN>) which is the number of datasets that follow. 

<P>
Each dataset consists of twelve lines. Each line will contain the closing balance of his bank account for a particular 
month. Each number will be positive and displayed to the penny. No dollar sign will be included.

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2> 

<P>
For each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The dataset number as a decimal 
integer (start counting at one), a space, a character `<TT>$</TT>', and a single number, the average (mean) of the closing balances 
for the twelve months. It will be rounded to the nearest penny.
