It's hard to construct a problem that's so easy that everyone will get 
it, yet still difficult enough to be worthy of some respect. Usually, we
 err on one side or the other. How simple can a problem really be? 

</p><p>
Here, as in Celebrity Jepoardy, questions and answers are a bit 
confused, and, because the participants are celebrities, there's a real 
need to make the challenges simple. Your program needs to prepare a 
question to be solved -- an equation to be solved -- given the answer. 
Specifically, you have to write a program which finds the <span class="textit">simplest</span>
 possible equation to be solved given the answer, considering all 
possible equations using the standard mathematical symbols in the usual 
manner. In this context, simplest can be defined unambiguously several 
different ways leading to the same path of resolution. For now, find the
 equation whose transformation into the desired answer requires the 
least effort. 

</p><p>
For example, given the answer <tt>X = 2</tt>, you might create the equation <tt>9 - X = 7</tt>. Alternately, you could build the system <code>X &gt; 0; X^2 = 4</code>. These may not be the simplest possible equations. Solving these mind-scratchers might be hard for a celebrity.
