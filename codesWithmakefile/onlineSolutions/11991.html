<h1>Problem E</h1>
<h2>Easy Problem from Rujia Liu?</h2>
</center>

<p><i>Though Rujia Liu usually sets hard problems for contests (for example, regional contests like Xi'an 2006, Beijing 2007 and Wuhan 2009, or UVa OJ contests like Rujia Liu's Presents 1 and 2), he occasionally sets easy problem (for example, 'the Coco-Cola Store' in UVa OJ), to encourage more people to solve his problems :D</i></p>

<p>Given an array, your task is to find the k-th occurrence (from left to right) of an integer v. To make the problem more difficult (and interesting!), you'll have to answer m such queries.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n, m(1<=n,m<=100,000), the number of elements in the array, and the number of queries. The next line contains n positive integers not larger than 1,000,000. Each of the following m lines contains two integer k and v (1<=k<=n, 1<=v<=1,000,000). The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF). The size of input file does not exceed 5MB.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, print the 1-based location of the occurrence. If there is no such element, output 0 instead.</p>
