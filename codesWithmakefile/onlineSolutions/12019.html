<p>No. Doom's day algorithm is not a method to compute which day
the world will end. It is an algorithm created by the mathematician
John Horton Conway, to calculate which day of the week (Monday,
Tuesday, etc.) corresponds to a certain date.</p>
<p>This algorithm is based in the idea of the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">doomsday</span>, a certain
day of
the week which always occurs in the same dates. For example, 4/4 (the
4th of April), 6/6 (the 6th of June), 8/8 (the 8th of August), 10/10
(the 10th of October) and 12/12 (the 12th of December) are dates which
always occur in doomsday. All years have their own doomsday.</p>
<p>In year 2011, doomsday is Monday. So all of 4/4, 6/6, 8/8,
10/10 and 12/12 are Mondays. Using that information, you can easily
compute any other date. For example, the 13th of December 2011 will be
Tuesday, the 14th of December 2011 will be Wednesday, etc.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION1"><font color="#0070e8">The
Problem</font></a></h2>
<p>Other days which occur on doomsday are 5/9, 9/5, 7/11 and
11/7. Also, in
leap years, we have the following doomsdays: 1/11 (the 11th of January)
and 2/22 (the 22nd of
Febrary), and in non-leap years 1/10 and 2/21.</p>
<p>Given a date of year 2011, you have to compute which day of
the week it occurs.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION2"><font color="#0070e8">Input</font></a></h2>
<p>The input can contain different test cases. The first line of
the input indicates the number of test cases.</p>
<p>For each test case, there is a line with two numbers: M D. M
represents the month (from 1 to 12) and D represents the day (from 1 to
31). The date will always be valid.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION2"><font color="#0070e8">Output</font></a></h2>
<p>For each test case, you have to output the day of the week
where that date occurs in 2011. The days of the week will be: Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.</p>
