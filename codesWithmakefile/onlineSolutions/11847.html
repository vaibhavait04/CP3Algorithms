</H1>
A creditor wants a daily payment during <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> days from a poor miner in debt. 
Since the miner can not pay his daily obligation, he has negotiated with the
creditor an alternative way, convenient for both parties, to pay his debt: 
the miner will give an equivalent of a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11847img1.png"
 ALT="$ \mu$"></SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="MATH">= 0.001<I>mm</I></SPAN>) long piece 
of a silver bar as a guarantee towards the debt. 
The silver bar owned by the poor miner is initially <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11847img1.png"
 ALT="$ \mu$"></SPAN> units long.

<P>
By the end of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> days the miner would not have any more silver to give  
and the creditor would have received an amount of silver equivalent to
that of the silver bar initially owned by the miner.
By then, the miner expected to have enough money to pay the debt 
at the next day so that he would have back all his silver.

<P>
With this negotiation in mind, the miner has realized that it was not necessary 
to cut exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11847img1.png"
 ALT="$ \mu$"></SPAN> silver piece from the bar everyday. For instance, at the third day he 
could give the creditor a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3<IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11847img1.png"
 ALT="$ \mu$"></SPAN> silver piece, taking back the equivalent of a <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11847img1.png"
 ALT="$ \mu$"></SPAN> 
silver piece which the creditor should already have. 

<P>
Since cutting the bar was 
rather laborious and time consuming, the miner wanted to minimize the 
number of cuts he needed to perform on his silver bar in order to make the daily silver deposits
during the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> days. Could you help him?  

<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
Input consists of several cases, each one defined by a line containing a positive integer number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> 
(representing the length in micras of the silver bar and the number of days of the amortization period). 
You may assume that <!-- MATH
 $0 < n < 20000$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0 &lt; <I>n</I> &lt; 20000</SPAN>.

<P>
The end of the input is recognized by a line with <SPAN CLASS="MATH">0</SPAN>.

<P>
For each given case, output one line with a single number: the minimum number of cuts 
in which to cut a silver bar of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I><IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11847img1.png"
 ALT="$ \mu$"></SPAN> to guarantee the debt during <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> days.
