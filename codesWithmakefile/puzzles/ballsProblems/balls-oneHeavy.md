### 9 balls with one ball heavier than others 

Divide them in groups of 3a,3b,3c
1) Weight (3a,3b) balls 
Result
 a) 3a = 3b ==> 3c has the heavy ball 
 b) 3a != 3b ==> 3a or 3b heavy take the heavy one out.
2) Remaining 3 from above 
Take 1a,1b,1c from left overs weight 1a and 1b 
 a) 1a = 1b ==> 1c heavy 
 b) 1a ! 1b ==> the ball which goes down is heavy 

Hence the heavy ball is found.
