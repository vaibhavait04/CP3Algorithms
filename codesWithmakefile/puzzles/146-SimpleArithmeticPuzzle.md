### Problem 

Charlie and the chocolate factory 

Charlie once visited chocolate factory to buy some chocolates.Chocolate cost Rs. 3 each and he had only Rs. 45.He was disappointed. He wanted more. But when he reached the factory he was amazed. There was a scheme on that special day. If you return 3 wrappers of the chocolate you will get one chocolate for free. So how many chocolates can he buy?

### Solution 

22 

Charlie has Rs. 45 and each chocolate cost Rs. 3. So he buys only 15. But there is a scheme. He will return 15 wrappers and get 5 chocolates free. Then he will return 3 out of 5 and get one free. And he will again use one wrapper with the remaining 2 to get one more.

So 15+5+1+1 = 22.
