## Problem - Who Owns The Fish?

There are five houses in a row and in five different colors.
In each house lives a person from a different country.
Each person drinks a certain drink, plays a certain sport, and keeps a certain pet.
No two people drink the same drink, play the same sport, or keep the same pet.

    The Brit lives in a red house
    The Swede keeps dogs
    The Dane drinks tea
    The green house is on the left of the white house
    The green house owner drinks coffee
    The person who plays polo rears birds
    The owner of the yellow house plays hockey
    The man living in the house right in the center drinks milk
    The Norwegian lives in the first house
    The man who plays baseball lives next to the man who keeps cats
    The man who keeps horses lives next to the one who plays hockey
    The man who plays billiards drinks beer
    The German plays soccer
    The Norwegian lives next to the blue house
    The man who plays baseball has a neighbor who drinks water.
