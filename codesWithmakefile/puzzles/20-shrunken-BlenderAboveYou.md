### Puzzle 

You are shrunk to the height of a nickel and your mass is proportionally reduced so as to maintain your original density. You are then thrown into an empty glass blender. The blades will start moving in 60 seconds. What do you do?

Lay down. I think that, with my blender at least I could lay down or stand with my back against the glass and be just fine.

Use Laminar flow zone: 

* First off, is my height the height of the nickel on its edge or lying flat? I guess it doesn't matter... since the bottom of the blender doesn't rotate, I'd duck down below the height of the blades and wedge myself in outside bottom corner of the blender. 
* There should be a laminar flow zone in that vicinity where the air current would be least likely to suck me in. I'd try to wedge my fingers between the bottom gasket and the metal base plate and hang on for dear life.

Oh, and scream my fool head off for help.

Use Axis of rotation: 

* Stand on the axis of rotation
* Lie below the blades near the axis of rotation so that the blades can pass above me.
