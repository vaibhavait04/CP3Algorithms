### Problem 

1. You are at a game show and there are three closed doors. There is a prize hidden behind one of the doors and the game show host knows where it is. You are asked to choose a door. The game show host then opens one of the other two doors showing that it is empty and asks you if you would like to change your selection. Should you stick to your original selection?

### Solution 

It is better if you select the other door. Since there are three doors then there is a 67% chance that you choose the wrong door with your first selection.
If you are wrong the game show host will select the other wrong door since she knows where the prize is hidden. 
Therefore it is better if you switch to the door which the game show host leaves closed.
