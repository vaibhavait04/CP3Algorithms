### Problem 1

One rope burns in 60 min 

There are two lengths of rope. Each one can burn in exactly one hour. They are not necessarily of the same length or width as each other. They also are not of uniform width (may be wider in middle than on the end), thus burning half of the rope is not necessarily 1/2 hour.

By burning the ropes, how do you measure exactly 45 minutes worth of time?

## Solution 1

If you light both ends of one rope, it will burn in exactly a 1/2 hour. Thus, burn one rope from both ends and the other rope from only one end. Once the one rope (which is burning from both ends) finally burns out (and you know a 1/2 hour has elapsed), you also know that the other rope (which is buring from only one end) has exactly 1/2 hour left to burn. Since you only want 45 minutes, light the second end of the rope. This remaining piece will burn in 15 minutes. Thus, totaling 45 minutes.

### Problem 54

Tick Tock 
With a seven-minute hourglass and an eleven-minute hourglass, what is the quickest way to time the boiling of an egg for fifteen minutes?

### Solution 2

Start the 7 and 11 minute hourglasses when the egg is dropped into the boiling water. 
When the sand stops running in the 7-glass, turn it over. When the sand stops in the 11-glass, turn the 7-glass over again.
When the sand stops in the 7-glass, 15 minutes will have elapsed.


### Problem 81

81 - Time to fuse 

You have a string-like fuse that burns in exactly one minute. The fuse is inhomogeneous, and it may burn slowly at first, then quickly, then slowly, and so on. You have a match, and no watch. How do you measure exactly 30 seconds?

### Solution 3

Regardless of the pace at which the fuse burns at any given position on, the two flames will meet at the 30 second mark. For example, if the 90% of the string takes 30 seconds to burn, it means the last 10% also takes 30 seconds. Lighting from both ends means the flame will meet at the 10%/90% position on the string, but this occurs after 30 seconds.
