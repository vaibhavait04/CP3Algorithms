## The Problem:

A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river.  
He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing.

* If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken.  
* If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn.

How does the man do it?

 
The Solution:

* The man and the chicken cross the river, (the fox and corn are safe together), he leaves the chicken on the other side and goes back across.
* The man then takes the fox across the river, and since he can't leave the fox and chicken together, he brings the chicken back.
* Again, since the chicken and corn can't be left together, he leaves the chicken and he takes the corn across and leaves it with the fox.
* He then returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time.
