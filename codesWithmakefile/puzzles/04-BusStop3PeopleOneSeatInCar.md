## Problem statement 

Youâ€™re driving your car to work in the pouring rain when you see three people on the side of the road at an uncovered bus stop. You recognize one as your best friend waiting to go to work, the second is you perfect lover someone that if you met you would eventually get married to, and the third is an elderly woman soaked to the bone, shivering and needs to go to the hospital.

The problem is that you only have one extra seat in your car so who do you give a ride to?

## Solution

You give your friend the keys, tell them to drive the old woman to the hospital, and wait for the bus with your perfect lover.
