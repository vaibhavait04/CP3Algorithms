## Problem 

This incredible problem was first made famous by Martin Gardner with his ‘Mathematical Games’ column published in Scientific American throughout the 60s and 70s.

A cylindrical hole, 6 inches long, has been drilled straight through the centre of a solid sphere. What is the volume remaining in the sphere?

No additional data is needed to solve this. (really!)


## Solution 
Answer = 36pi inch^3 

Without using calculus, one of the key equations to solving this problem is the volume of a spherical “cap”. That is the volume above a plane that has bisected a sphere. It is (1/6)πh(3r2 + h2) (where h is the altitude of the cap, and r is its radius). (See the mathworld page for more info)

The volume remaining in the sphere will be the volume of the sphere – (the volume of the “hole” + 2*(volume of the cap)). Refer to the drawing below for clarification.

The volume of the sphere is simply 4/3πR3. The volume of the hole is 6π(R2 – 9). The volume of both of the caps can be obtained by plugging in h = R – 3, and r = sqrt(R2 – 9)) .

After a long, boring simplification, we find that all the terms cancel to leave 36pi!

Try it for yourself.
