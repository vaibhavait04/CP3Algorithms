## One rope burns in 60 min

There are two lengths of rope. Each one can burn in exactly one hour. They are not necessarily of the same length or width as each other. They also are not of uniform width (may be wider in middle than on the end), thus burning half of the rope is not necessarily 1/2 hour.

By burning the ropes, how do you measure exactly 45 minutes worth of time?

## Solution 

If you light both ends of one rope, it will burn in exactly a 1/2 hour. Thus, burn one rope from both ends and the other rope from only one end. Once the one rope (which is burning from both ends) finally burns out (and you know a 1/2 hour has elapsed), you also know that the other rope (which is buring from only one end) has exactly 1/2 hour left to burn. Since you only want 45 minutes, light the second end of the rope. This remaining piece will burn in 15 minutes. Thus, totaling 45 minutes.

### Problem 

Tick Tock 
With a seven-minute hourglass and an eleven-minute hourglass, what is the quickest way to time the boiling of an egg for fifteen minutes?

### Solution 

Start the 7 and 11 minute hourglasses when the egg is dropped into the boiling water. 
When the sand stops running in the 7-glass, turn it over. When the sand stops in the 11-glass, turn the 7-glass over again.
When the sand stops in the 7-glass, 15 minutes will have elapsed.
