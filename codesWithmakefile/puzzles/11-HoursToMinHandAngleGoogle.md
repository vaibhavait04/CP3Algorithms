### Problem 

How many degrees are there in the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock when the time is a quarter past three?

### Solution 

The most common guess is 0°, but the actual answer is 7.5°.

At 3:15, the minute hand sits at the 3, but the hour hand is 1/4 of the way between 3 and 4. If the clock has 360° divided by 12 hours = 30°/hour. And 1/4 of 30°

= 7.5°
