### Problem 

Jelly beans

You have three jars that are all mislabeled. One contains peanut butter jelly beans, another grape jelly jelly beans and the third has a mix of both (not necessarily half-half mix). How many jelly beans would you have to pull out and out of which jars, to find out how to fix the labels on the jars?

Labels on jars are as follows
Jar 1 : Peanut butter
Jar 2 : Grape
Jar 3 : P.b. / Grape

### Solution 

Only one jelly bean from the p.b./grape jar will do the trick.

The trick here is to realize that every jar is mislabeled. Therefore you know that the peanut butter jelly bean jar is not the peanut butter jelly bean jar and the same goes for the rest.
You also need to realize that it is the jar labeled p.b./grape, labelled as the mix jar, that is your best hope. If you choose a jelly bean out of there, then you will know whether that jar is peanut butter or grape jelly jelly beans. It can’t be the mix jar because i already said that every jar is mislabeled.
Once you know that jar 3 is either peanut butter, or grape jelly, then you know the other jars also. If it is peanut butter, then jar 2 must be mixed because it can’t be grape (as its labeled) and it can’t be peanut butter (that’s jar 3). Hence jar 1 is grape.
If jar 3 is grape, then you know jar 1 must be the mix because it can’t be p.b. (as its labeled) and it can’t be grape (that’s jar 3). Hence jar 2 is peanut butter.


### Problem description 2

You have three bags and three labels. One bag has only red balls, one has only blue balls and one has both red and blue balls. Three labels are R, B and RB. R label was meant for the bag with only red balls, B label was meant for the bag with only blue balls and RB for the bag with both red and blue balls. Ram by mistake labelled the bags wrongly such that all the labels are wrong, how many minimum number of balls he should pick and from what bags to correct the labels? It is given that each bag has unlimited number of balls to be picked.

### Solution 

The minimum number of balls he should pick is 1 from the bag with label RB.

How ?
As the label of all the bags are wrong, bag with label RB can either have all red balls or all blue balls.
Now ram will either get red ball or the blue ball.

Case 1: Ram gets the red ball
Bag with label RB is the bag with all the red balls(R).
Bag with label B can either be RB or R(as all the labels are wrong) but as we already know R bag so it can only be RB.
We know 2 bags correctly so third bag with label R should be B.

Case 2: Ram gets the blue ball
Bag with label RB is the bag with all the blue balls(B).
Bag with label R can either be B or RB(as all the labels are wrong) but as we already know B bag so it can only be RB.
we know 2 bags correctly so third bag with label B should be R.
