### Puzzle 

Stuck in a brick building 

A man is stuck inside an all brick building (floor, ceiling, and walls are all brick), that has no windows and no doors, and inside with him he has only a wooden board and a saw, how does he get out?

### Hints 

He saws the board in half. two halves make a whole. he puts the whole against the wall and climbs out.
This is a bit on the abstract side, but still fun though, I think.

He takes the saw and cuts a hole in the wood, he takes the hole puts it in the wall. When he gets outside, he shouts till his voice gets horse, he then takes the horse and rides home.
