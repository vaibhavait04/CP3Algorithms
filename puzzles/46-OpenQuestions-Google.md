### Problem 

> How many golf balls can fit in a school bus?
> How much should you charge to wash all the windows in Seattle?
> How many piano tuners are there in the entire world?

How are you supposed to answer these!?


### Solution 

As this questions may require 10-20 minutes therefore this cant be questions which should be answered correctly rather with confidence and tricks. Therefore this questions have to be answered as 1)How many golf balls can fit in a school bus? Ans. 2365 (give any number) and say if there were more balls they would have fallen from doors and windows. 2)How many piano tuners are there in the entire world? Ans.156782 rest are still learning 3)How much should you charge to wash all the windows in Seattle? Ans.15623486 as we may cut some amount for windows that get dirty again.


These are questions of estimation, presumably. If you can create an accurate model and extrapolate, you can make a good estimate. My own estimation abilities aren't great, but for example, imagine that a golf ball is about 4 cubed inches in volume, while a bus is about (5 x 10 x 20)ft = 12000 cubed inches. (all these are estimates, so probably off, but order of magnitude are the vital piece), so this means that we could probably fit around 3,000 golf balls in a school bus. Each piece of the estimate is dependent on one's internal ability to gauge the size of an object or thing - or access to knowledge. Here, the golf ball I looked up. For the bus, I guessed the height based off knowing that even 6ft people can fit on a bus, (10 is still a bit large, but accounts for wheels, plus a bit more factors) The length and width I extrapolated from an estimated proportion of relativity. ( I guessed that a bus is about 2x as long as high). All in all, while my answer certainly isn't right, it's likely in the right factor, or maybe a factor off. I'm not going to go this for the rest, but the idea is similar.
