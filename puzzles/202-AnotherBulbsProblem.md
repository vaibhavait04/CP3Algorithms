### Problem 

Another bulb problem 

On a circle there are 2014 light bulbs, 2 are ON, and 2012 are OFF. You can choose any bulb and change the neighborâ€™s state from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON. Doing so, can we get all 2014 light bulbs on ? If yes, How?

### Solution 

Lets represent 1->On, 0->Off. As the question says 2 bulbs are on & 2012 are off.
Consider the following list rep. as a cycle. For eg. in the list "X Y Z . . . A", A immeditaely follows X.

1, 0, 0, 0, 0, . . . 0, 1, where # of zeros = 2012.

The one point answer is, if "<number of 0's b/w extreme two ones> % 4 == 0" , then we can make all 2014 bulbs ON. some of the Possible inputs can be.

List of "1, <1000 zeros> ,1, <1012 zeros>
List of "1, <2012 zeros>, 1"

why <number of 0's b/w extreme two ones> % 4 ==0, solves this ?
Ans:

case1 : # of 0s=4
1 0 0 0 0 1->
select 2nd '0' from left, and turn its adjacent 1st, 3rd zeros to 1.
1 1 0 1 0 1
select 3rd '1' from left, and turn its adjacent zeros to 1.
1 1 1 1 1 1.

similarly we can switch all off bulbs b/w already 2 switched on bulbs, if they are multiples of 4.
