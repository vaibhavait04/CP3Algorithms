### Puzzle 

Clever Commuter 

Every day, Fred takes the train to travel from his work back to Alkmaar, his place of residence. Usually, he arrives at the station of Alkmaar at six o’clock, and exactly at that moment he is picked up by his wife by car. Yesterday evening, Fred took an earlier train, without informing his wife, and therefore he already was at the station of Alkmaar at five o’clock. He decided to walk part of the way to meet his wife. When he met the car with his wife, he drove home with her. In this way, they were home ten minutes earlier than normal.

How long did Fred walk yesterday evening?

### Solution 

Fred’s wife needed to drive ten minutes less than usual, which is five minutes less in the direction of the station and five minutes less back home. 
Therefore, Fred met his wife at five minutes to six. He had walked already since five o’clock, so he walked 55 minutes in total.

10 min earlier than usual => Total saved 5 min each side
5 min gained from car distance because of 55 min walking. 


Note: Problem is not to find out the time taken to reach from home to station.
