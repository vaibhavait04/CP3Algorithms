### Problem 

How can you represent days of month using two 6 sided dice ?

You can write one number on each face of the dice from 0 to 9 and you have to represent days from 1 to 31, for example for 1, one dice should show 0 and another should show 1, similarly for 31 one dice should show 3 and another should show 1.

represent days of month using two dice

### Solution 

Answer is:
Dice 1: 0 1 2 3 5 7
Dice 2: 0 1 2 4 6 8

How?
Basically you have to show 11, 22 so 1 and 2 should be present in both dices, similarly to show 01, 09 0 should be present in both dices, now the trick is for showing 9 you can use dice with 6 printed on one of the face.
