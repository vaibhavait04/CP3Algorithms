### Puzzle: Heaven

A man died and went to Heaven. There were thousands of other people there. 
They were all naked and all looked as they did at the age of 21. He looked around to see if there was anyone he recognised. 
He saw a couple and he knew immediately that they were Adam and Eve. 
How did he know?

### Answer 

He recognized Adam and Eve as the only people without navels. Because they were not born of women, they had never had umbilical cords and therefore they never had navels.  This one seems perfectly logical but it can sometimes spark fierce theological arguments!
