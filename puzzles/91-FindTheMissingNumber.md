### Problem 

In this table, each row across follows the same pattern of numbers. See if you can discern the pattern and fill in the missing number in the bottom row.

7 4 8

3 9 7

6 5 10

? 8 4

* Hint - use what can result on applying arithmetic operations on the numbers. 

### Solution 

(7×4) - 8  = 20 
(3×9) - 7  = 20 
(6×5) - 10 = 20 
(_3_×8) - 4  = 20

The answer is 3.
