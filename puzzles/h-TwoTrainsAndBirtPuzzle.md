### Puzzle 

Two trains X and Y (80 km from each other) are running towards each other on the same track with a speed of 40km/hr. A bird starts from the train X and travels towards train Y with constant speed of 100km/hr. Once it reaches train Y, it turns and starts moving toward train X. It does this till the two trains collides with each other. Find the total distance traveled by the bird?

Maximum time to solve the puzzle : 1 Minutes

Difficulty level of the puzzle : Low

What is the interviewer looking for : Your approach. If you start calculating distance from X to Y and the Y to X and so on, you have already been rejected.

### Solution  

Velocity of approach for the two trains = (40 + 40) km/hr

Total time the trains will take to collide = 80km/80km/hr = 1 hour

Total distance travelled by the bird = 100km/hr * 1hr = 100 km.
