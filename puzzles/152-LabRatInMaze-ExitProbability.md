### Problem 

Lab rat in a maze 

Consider a lab rat in a maze. There are four paths that can be taken with equal probability. 
 Path A leads to exit in 5 minutes. 
 Path B leads back to start and takes 8 minutes.
 Path C leads to exit in 3 minutes and last
 Path D is 2 minutes long and leads back to start. 
What is the expected escape time of this poor rat from the maze?

### Solution 

9 mins 

t = (1/4)*5 +  (1/4)*(8+t) +  (1/4)*3  + (1/4)*(2+t)
t = 9
