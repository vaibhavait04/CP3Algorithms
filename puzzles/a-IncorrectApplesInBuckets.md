## Problem 

There has been a mistake at the apple farm
Someone has mixed up the apples. Read carefully what has happened. Can you find a way to help fix the mistake.

    There are 10 baskets containing apples.
    There are various amounts of apples in each basket ranging from 10 to 20.
    9 of the baskets have apples weighing 4 ounces each.
    1 of the baskets has apples weighing 5 ounces each.
    All the apples look the same.
    The equipment you have is a set of scales and an empty basket.
    It is late and the truck is waiting to take the apples to market. You only have time to make one measurement using the scales.


## Solution 

Number Each Basket from 1 to 10.  
	Select 1 Apple from basket 1
	Select 2 Apples from basket 2
	etc..

You will now have (1+2+...+10) = 55 Apples

If they all weighed 4 oz, then the scales would show 55x4=220 oz.

But if the weight was, say, 225 oz, then you would know that there 5 apples that weigh an extra ounce, so the basket with the heavier apples must be basket 5.
