### Puzzle 

Classic Knights & Knaves

Raymond Smullyan has made a career of writing logic problems. His most famous have to do with a mythical island of Knights and Knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and Knaves always lie.

As you approach the island, you spot three inhabitants on the shore. You call out to them, “Are you Knights or Knaves?” 

The first says something but you do not hear what he says, so you ask, “What did you say?” 
The second inhabitant says, “He says he is a Knight, he is and so am I.” 
The third responds, “He is a Knave, but I am a Knight.” 

Figure out the true identities of the three individuals.

### Solution 

They are Knight, Knight and Knave. The most basic rule of Knight and Knave island is that no one ever says they are a Knave. 
Knights always say they are Knights because they tell the truth, Knaves say they are Knights because they always lie. 
The second must be a Knight, otherwise he would have lied about the firsts response and if so, he must be telling the truth about the first. 
The third must therefore be a Knave.


### Similar - Lie tribe and Truth tribe

There are two tribes in Mars, Lie tribe and Truth Tribe.

Lie tribe always speaks lie, True tribe always speaks truth.

You meet three mars people and ask

From First Person: What tribe you belong to?, he replies something in his language which you don’t understand.

Second person tells that he is saying that he belongs to Lie Tribe.

Third person says that second person is lying.

What tribe does the third person belong to?


### Solution 
Trick is to start from first person. may be you want to think once again before reading the explanation :).

Lets assume that first person is from Truth tribe, then he will say that i am from truth tribe, in this case second person is lying.

Now assume that first person is from Lie tribe, then also he will say that i belong to truth tribe(as he is a lier), so second person is lying again in this case as well.

Thus third person is correct in both the scenarios, hence he belongs to Truth Tribe.
