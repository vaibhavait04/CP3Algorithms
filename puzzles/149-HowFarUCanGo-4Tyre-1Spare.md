### Problem 

How far you can go ? 

You have a 4 wheels car and a spare tire in the trunk.  
The tire being used will be worn off for 1/4 part of it per mile (completely wear out for 4 miles) 
How to make use of the spare tire to go as far as possible?

### Solution 

Replace the tires in following way, you can drive for 5 miles.

The numbers denote the lives of tires. The tricky part is to switch the tires after every mile you drive.

Begin:
    4__4

car : | | spare tire: 4
    4__4

After the first one mile:
    4__3

car : | | spare tire: 3
    3__3

After the second one mile:
    3__3

car : | | spare tire: 2
    2__2

you got the idea...
    2---2

car : | | spare tire: 1
    2---1
    1---1

car : | | spare tire: 0
    1---1
