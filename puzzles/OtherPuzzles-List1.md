### Puzzle 
You are in solitary confinement. It is Friday afternoon and you absolutely must have a cigarette. The only person who can give you one is the guard outside your cell. What do you do?

To get the guard to give you a cigarette (and this really is the preferred answer to this question), threaten to kill yourself by smashing your head against the wall of your cell. That gives you leverage with the guard - he’d be tied up by doing paperwork about your suicide, so he’d miss weekend time with his family (it’s Friday afternoon, remember?) -- so he’ll give you a cigarette.
