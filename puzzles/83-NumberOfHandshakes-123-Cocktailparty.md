### Problem 

Nice to meet you

At a secret meeting, everyone shakes hands exactly once with every other person present. Altogether there are forty-five handshakes. How many people attended the meeting?

### Solution 

Each person shakes hands with nine others and each handshake is shared by two people.

Sum = ( n * (n-1) ) / 2

### Other version

Cocktail Party 

You are observing a cocktail party that has seven guests. You notice that each guest shakes hands with one another once they meet, but never again. How many handshakes occurred during the cocktail party?

### Solution 

Answer 21. 

Many people quickly rush to the answer of 42 since 7(7-1) = 42. However, you must remember that once person A shakes hands with person B, person B does not re-shake hands with person A again. Therefore, the solution become (7(7-1))/2 = 21, or 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.


### Problem 

At a party, everyone shook hands with everybody else. There were 66 handshakes. How many people were at the party?

### Solution 

lets say there are n persons
first person shakes hand with everyone else: n-1 times(n-1 persons)
second person shakes hand with everyone else(not with 1st as its already done): n-2 times
3rd person shakes hands with remaining persons: n-3

So total handshakes will be = (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) +…… 0;
= (n-1)*(n-1+1)/2 = (n-1)*n/2 = 66
= n^2 -n = 132
=(n-12)(n+11) = 0;
= n = 12 OR n =-11
-11 is ruled out so the answer is 12 persons.
