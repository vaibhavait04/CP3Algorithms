### Problem 

Nice to meet you

At a secret meeting, everyone shakes hands exactly once with every other person present. Altogether there are forty-five handshakes. How many people attended the meeting?

### Solution 

Each person shakes hands with nine others and each handshake is shared by two people.

Sum = ( n * (n-1) ) / 2

### Other version

Cocktail Party 

You are observing a cocktail party that has seven guests. You notice that each guest shakes hands with one another once they meet, but never again. How many handshakes occurred during the cocktail party?

### Solution 

Answer 21. 

Many people quickly rush to the answer of 42 since 7(7-1) = 42. However, you must remember that once person A shakes hands with person B, person B does not re-shake hands with person A again. Therefore, the solution become (7(7-1))/2 = 21, or 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.
