### Problem: 

A man walks 1 mile south, then 1 mile east, and finally 1 mile north to find himself in exactly the same position as he started. He is NOT at the north pole, nor does he shoot a bear. Where is he?

### Answer: 

(1 + 1/2pi) miles from the south pole.

The man could be on any point on the circle drawn 1 + 1/2pi miles from the south pole. (ignoring the curvature of the earth)

He walks 1 mile south, to get to 1/2pi miles from the south pole.
From here, if he walks 1 mile east, he will complete a full circumference of a circle and get back to his original spot.
Finally he walks 1 mile back up north to his starting location.

So what’s our running total of possible points? We have 1 + infinite points. But we’re not done yet!
Consider a ring that is half a mile in circumference near the South Pole. Walking a mile along this ring would cause us to circle twice, but still bring us to back to the point we started from. As a result, starting from a point that is one mile north of a half mile ring would also be valid. Similarly, for any positive integer n, there is a circle with radius
r = 1 / (2 * pi * n)
centered at the South Pole. Walking one mile along these rings would cause us to circle n times and return to the same point as we started. There are infinite possible values for n. Furthermore, there are infinite ways of determining a starting point that is one mile north of these n rings, thus giving us (infinity * infinity) possible points that satisfy the required condition.

So the real answer to this question is 1 + infinity * infinity = infinite possible points!
