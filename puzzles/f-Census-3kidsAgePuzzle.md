## The Puzzle:

A census taker approaches a house and asks the woman who answers the door "How many children do you have, and what are their ages?"
The woman replies "I have three children, the product of their ages are 36, the sum of their ages are equal to the address of the house next door."
The census taker walks next door, comes back and says "I need more information."
The woman replies "I have to go, my oldest child is sleeping upstairs."
Census taker then says "Thank you, I now have everything I need."

## The Solution:

The reason the census taker could not figure out the children's ages is because, even with knowing the number on the house next , there were still two possibilities.
The only way that the product could be 36 and still leave two possibilities is when the sum equals 13. These possibilities being 9, 2 and 2 and 6, 6 and 1.
When the home owner stated that her "oldest" child is sleeping she was giving ths census taker the fact that there is an "oldest".

So the children's ages are 9, 2 and 2. 

### Notes
Why other possible solutions are not shown. Answer: because there aren't any more! A key element of this puzzle is that the census taker needed more information!
For example, another way to factor 36 is 12, 3 and 1. The sum is 16. If the number next door had been 16, the census taker would not have needed to come back for more information.
Another factoring is 6, 3 and 2. The sum is 11. Once again, the census taker would not have needed to come back if that had been the number next door.
And nor will 4, 3 and 3 work because its sum of 10 is also unique.
Hope that makes sense!

### Problem version 2 

Man in bar - guesses age 

 A man walks into a bar, orders a drink, and starts chatting with the bartender. After a while, he learns that the bartender has three children. "How old are your children?" he asks. "Well," replies the bartender, "the product of their ages is 72." The man thinks for a moment and then says, "that's not enough information." "All right," continues the bartender, "if you go outside and look at the building number posted over the door to the bar, you'll see the sum of the ages." The man steps outside, and after a few moments he reenters and declares, "Still not enough!" The bartender smiles and says, "My youngest just loves strawberry ice cream." How old are the children? A variant of the problem is for the sum of the ages to be 13 and the product of the ages to be the number posted over the door. In this case, it is the oldest that loves ice cream. Then how old are they?

### Answer 

First, determine all the ways that three ages can multiply together to get 72:
	72 1 1 (quite a feat for the bartender)
	36 2 1
	24 3 1
	18 4 1
	18 2 2
	12 6 1
	12 3 2
	9 4 2
	9 8 1
	8 3 3
	6 6 2
	6 4 3

As the man says, that's not enough information; there are many possibilities. So the bartender tells him where to find the sum of the ages--the man now knows the sum even though we don't. Yet he still insists that there isn't enough info. This must mean that there are two permutations with the same sum; otherwise the man could have easily deduced the ages.

The only pair of permutations with the same sum are 8 3 3 and 6 6 2, which both add up to 14 (the bar's address). Now the bartender mentions his "youngest"--telling us that there is one child who is younger than the other two. This is impossible with 8 3 3--there are two 3 year olds. Therefore the ages of the children are 6, 6, and 2.

Pedants have objected that the problem is insoluble because there could be a youngest between two three year olds (even twins are not born exactly at the same time). However, the word "age" is frequently used to denote the number of years since birth. For example, I am the same age as my wife, even though technically she is a few months older than I am. And using the word "youngest" to mean "of lesser age" is also in keeping with common parlance. So I think the solution is fine as stated.

In the sum-13 variant, the possibilities are:
	11 1 1
	10 2 1
	9 3 1
	9 2 2
	8 4 1
	8 3 2
	7 5 1
	7 4 2
	7 3 3
	6 6 1
	6 5 2
	6 4 3

The two that remain are 9 2 2 and 6 6 1 (both products equal 36). The final bit of info (oldest child) indicates that there is only one child with the highest age. This cancels out the 6 6 1 combination, leaving the childern with ages of 9, 2, and 2.
