#Psycho killer puzzle 

While at the funeral of her mother, she met a man whom she did not know. She thought he was amazing, her dream guy, and she fell in love with him but never asked for his number and could not find him after the funeral. A few days later the girl killed her sister. What was her motive in killing her sister?

## Solution 
She was hoping that the guy would appear at the sister’s funeral. If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath. This was a test used to test if one has the same mentality as a killer. Many arrested serial killers have taken this test and answered it correctly. If you didn’t answer correctly, good for you. I’ll seriously like to know your response, please comment!
