### 9 balls with one ball heavier than others 

Divide them in groups of 3a,3b,3c
1) Weight (3a,3b) balls 
Result
 a) 3a = 3b ==> 3c has the heavy ball 
 b) 3a != 3b ==> 3a or 3b heavy take the heavy one out.
2) Remaining 3 from above 
Take 1a,1b,1c from left overs weight 1a and 1b 
 a) 1a = 1b ==> 1c heavy 
 b) 1a ! 1b ==> the ball which goes down is heavy 

Hence the heavy ball is found.

### Prob 67: 8 Marbles puzzle 

You have 8 lead marbles, one of which is heavier than the rest. What is the minimum amount of “weightings” (i.e. with a see-saw scale) you need to do to guarantee finding the odd one out?

### Solution 

Ans: 2 

1) 8 marbles → 3 3 2 2) Weigh 3 vs 3. If they are equal, weigh the remaining two. 3) If they are not equal, take the heavier one, weight two of the balls. If they are equal, the third one is the odd ball, if not, the heavier side is the odd ball.
