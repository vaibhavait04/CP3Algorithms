### Problem 

12 Balls - part 2 

You have 12 identical RUBBER balls each of 10 grams and one of 9 grams.You have three weighs of a weighing machine (not a balance scale) to determine which ball is different and whether it is heavier or lighter. Hint: You can do anything with the ball.

### Solution 

Divide balls into group of 6 and weigh any one group. One group weighs 59 grams.Now divide in group of 3 balls and weigh. One group weighs 29 grams.Now suppose balls A,B and C are left out of which one weighs 9 grams. Now select balls AB and cut any one say ball B into half. Now if 1)ball A is faulty, we will get reading 14 grams.

       2)ball B is faulty we will get reading 14.5 grams.
       3)ball C is faulty we will get reading 15 grams.

**I would like if you can give me some other solution
