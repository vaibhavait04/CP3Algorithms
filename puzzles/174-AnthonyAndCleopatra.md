### Puzzle Anthony and Cleopatra

Anthony and Cleopatra are lying dead on the floor of a villa in Egypt. Nearby is a broken bowl. 
There is no mark on either of their bodies and they were not poisoned. How did they die?

### Answer 

Anthony and Cleopatra were goldfish whose bowl was knocked over by a clumsy dog. 
This is one of a set of puzzles which deceive by using human names for animals.
This is not a very satisfactory basis for a good puzzle but despite that, the puzzle has enduring popularity.
